# Project: Touhou 06 (EoSD) Portable

This is the `portable` branch of [GensokyoClub/th06](https://github.com/GensokyoClub/th06), a decompilation and cross-platform port of 東方紅魔郷 ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil (1.02h) by Team Shanghai Alice.

## Overview

- **Portable branch**: Replaces DirectX 8 with SDL2 + OpenGL for native cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows).
- **Game data**: Uses original `.DAT` resource files alongside the compiled binary.
- The `master` branch (decompilation project) is NOT needed and was deleted from this machine.

## Current Machine Environment

- **Platform**: macOS (Apple Silicon, M4 Pro)
- **Compiler**: Apple Clang (Xcode Command Line Tools)
- **Dependencies installed via Homebrew**: `sdl2`, `sdl2_image`, `sdl2_ttf`, `premake`
- **Wine**: Installed but not needed for portable branch (was used for master branch devenv setup)

## Key Modification: Fullscreen Viewport Scaling Fix

**Problem**: On macOS Retina displays, fullscreen mode created a 640×480 window using `SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN`, rendering the game content in the bottom-left corner of the screen.

**Fix** (committed to this repo):
- Changed `SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN` → `SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP` in both `WebGL.cpp` and `FixedFunctionGL.cpp`
- After window creation, query actual drawable size via `SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize()`
- Compute a centered 4:3 viewport scale factor
- `SetViewport()` and `GetViewport()` apply scale + offset to map game coordinates (640×480) to the scaled centered area
- Added `viewportScale`, `viewportOffsetX`, `viewportOffsetY` member variables to both backend classes

**Files changed**:
- `src/graphics/WebGL.cpp` — lines in `Create()` and `SetViewport()`/`GetViewport()`
- `src/graphics/WebGL.hpp` — added 3 member variables
- `src/graphics/FixedFunctionGL.cpp` — same changes (backup backend)
- `src/graphics/FixedFunctionGL.hpp` — same 3 member variables

**Note**: `ReadPixels()` was intentionally left unscaled to avoid buffer size mismatches. If texture capture issues arise, revisit.

## Build Instructions

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/th06-portable
premake5 gmake          # Generate Makefile
cd build && make -j16   # Compile
```

The binary is produced at `~/Downloads/th06-portable/th06`.

## Run Instructions

```bash
cd "/Users/remi/Downloads/[th06] 东方红魔乡 (汉化版)"
./th06_portable
```

The config tool (`./th06_config`) allows switching between fullscreen/windowed mode, refresh rate, and color depth.

## What Was Deleted

- `~/Downloads/th06-master/` (~3.4G) — Decompilation project (master branch), including VS2002 devenv
- `~/.wineth06` (~335M) — Wine prefix created for the master branch build system

Both were artifacts from an initial attempt to run the Chinese-patched EXE via Wine (failed) and set up the decompilation build environment (not needed for portable).

## Git Remote Setup

```
origin  → https://github.com/GensokyoClub/th06.git  (upstream)

Current branch: `main`.

## PBG3 Format (DAT files)

All `.DAT` files are compressed with PBG3, ZUN's custom bit-level compression format. Implementation in `src/pbg3/`.

### DAT file inventory

| DAT file | Size | Contents |
|----------|------|----------|
| `紅魔郷CM.DAT` | 935 KB | ANM sprite/animation definitions — textures, sprite UV coords, animation scripts |
| `紅魔郷ED.DAT` | 2.1 MB | Ending sequence data |
| `紅魔郷IN.DAT` | 980 KB | ECL enemy scripts — bullet patterns, stage configuration |
| `紅魔郷MD.DAT` | 1.2 MB | Audio — MIDI sequences + WAV samples |
| `紅魔郷ST.DAT` | 3.3 MB | Stage data — backgrounds, enemy placement, layout |
| `紅魔郷TL.DAT` | 1.3 MB | Title screen data |

### File structure

```
┌─ Magic "PBG3" (4 bytes, 0x33474250)
├─ Compressed bitstream
│   ├─ Entries prefixed by name string (ReadString)
│   ├─ Variable-length integers (ReadVarInt)
│   └─ Raw binary blocks (ReadByteAlignedData)
└─ CRC checksum
```

### Core algorithm

**VarInt (variable-length integer)**

Reads 2 header bits to determine the integer's bit width, then reads the value:
```
00 → 8-bit   (0 to 255)
01 → 16-bit  (0 to 65535)
10 → 24-bit  (0 to 16.7M)
11 → 32-bit
```

This is the main space-saving mechanism — most game data (coordinates, IDs, frame counts) are small values that fit in 8 or 16 bits, but the format can store 32-bit values when needed. No dictionary, no Huffman trees, no back-references.

**Bit-level reading**

The parser consumes the stream one bit at a time via `bitIdxInCurByte` (0x80 → 1 → 0x80 cyclic). Each byte from disk is read only when the previous one is fully consumed:

```
byte:   [b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1 b0]
         ↑                   ↓
         bitIdx=0x80    bitIdx=1
```

Adjacent fields don't need byte alignment — a 3-bit flag followed by a 15-bit value uses only 18 bits total, not 4 bytes.

**ReadInt(n)**

Reads `n` bits MSB-first, where `n` is passed as a power-of-two exponent (e.g., ReadInt(8) reads 8 bits, ReadInt(3) reads 8 bits via 2^3=8). Used for reading magic numbers, filenames, and known-width fields.

**SeekToNextByte()**

Skips remaining bits in the current byte (discards partial byte) to align to byte boundary. Used before ReadByteAlignedData which reads raw uncompressed binary (texture pixels, WAV audio, etc.).

### Why no standard compression

ZUN wrote this himself to avoid external library dependencies. The game was built with Visual Studio 2002 and no package manager existed. PBG3 is ~200 lines of C++ (src/pbg3/IPbg3Parser.cpp + Pbg3Parser.cpp). It achieves good compression on game data because:
- Most values are small integers (coordinates, IDs, counts)
- Texture names are short repeated strings
- Pixel data and audio remain uncompressed within the stream
